# Update Wed. July 11, 2018

1. XNOR Gate by simple 2-layer Neural Network:
Using sigmoid for the all layers' activation and square error as a cost function.
Using AdamOptimizer for the neural network.
XNOR = AND || (NOT x1)AND(NOT x2)

2. Simple Generative Adversarial Networks:
Approximating a 1-dimensional Gaussian distribution.

3. A Multi-layer Neural Network implementation
Implementation to recognize the MNIST database of handwritten digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
Tried ReLU as activation function for hidden layer instaed of softmax and cross entropy.
